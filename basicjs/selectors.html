<strong>Selecting an Element</strong>
<br/>
The primary reason for Javascript is to make HTML documents
and handle user interaction with the web page.

<ul>
  <li>You want to know where a user clicked.</li>
  <li>You want to display a photo-galary with an overlay.</li>
  <li>You want to submit forms without the user to leave the page.</li>
</ul>

Doing this often beings with <span class="ephasis">selecting an element</span> or elements, and then performing operations on them.

<div class="jm_html">
  <div class="small_block" id="selection1">Element with id="selection1"</div>
</div>

<script>
jmJsFuncs = [function() {
  // With JQuery
  var selection1 = $("#selection1"); // Get the content of the element.
}];
</script>
