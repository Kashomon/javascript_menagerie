<strong>Sonnet CXXIV</strong>

<div class="jm_html">
<p id="sonnet">
If my dear love were but the child of state,<br>
It might for Fortune's bastard be unfather'd'<br>
As subject to Time's love or to Time's hate,<br>
Weeds among weeds, or flowers with flowers gather'd.<br>
No, it was builded far from accident;<br>
It suffers not in smiling pomp, nor falls<br>
Under the blow of thralled discontent,<br>
Whereto the inviting time our fashion calls:<br>
It fears not policy, that heretic,<br>
Which works on leases of short-number'd hours,<br>
But all alone stands hugely politic,<br>
That it nor grows with heat nor drowns with showers.<br>
To this I witness call the fools of time,<br>
Which die for goodness, who have lived for crime.
